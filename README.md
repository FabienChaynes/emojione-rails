# Emojione::Rails [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/emojione-rails.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/emojione-rails)

Sprocket/Rails emojione package, see http://emojione.com

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'emojione-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install emojione-rails

## Sync images

Images can be copied to your public directory with `rake emojione` in your app. This is the recommended approach since the images will be available at a consistent location. This works best with cached formatted user content generated by tools like [html-pipeline](https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline).

```
$ rake emojione
```

## Usage

In your JavaScript manifest (e.g. `application.js`):

    //= require emojione
    
In your CSS/SCSS manifest (e.g. `application.scss`):

    @import "emojione";

## Documentation

## Gotcha

This gem bundle emojione png and svg version but not the sprites (for size purposes mainly). If you need to use the emojione sprites, this gem is not for you.
